# Bringing vintage documentation back to life

When we talk about preserving computer heritage, we often think about
hardware, motherboards we repair, cassettes we dump and archive for
posterity.

But something essential is often missing: **knowledge**.

How can you find, without digging for 30 minutes, the exact syntax of a
6809 assembly routine?\
Or that obscure trick to compile a C program on the MO5?

That is exactly why I launched **retrocomputing-ai.cloud**: a RAG server
(*Retrieval-Augmented Generation*) designed to help bring machines back
to life... by making them **programmable again**.

## My approach: a very focused development assistant

For now, I am deliberately focusing on a single playground: 👉 **the
Thomson MO5**

BASIC is already well documented almost everywhere.\
But as soon as you get into:

-   **C**
-   **assembly**
-   low-level 6809 details

...the information becomes scattered, sometimes contradictory, and often
difficult to track down.

And let's be honest: I have an MO5 right here... that helps 😄

The idea is simple:

> ask a question in natural language,\
> and let the RAG find the right page, the right excerpt, the right
> explanation.

Eventually, I'd like to extend the platform to other legendary machines:
Commodore 64, Apple II, Amstrad CPC...

## A quick word on the technical side (without diving too deep into the cables)

The server relies on a fairly classic RAG pipeline, but designed to
remain **autonomous** and **low cost**.

Today:

-   I use a **local neural embedding model**
-   documents are transformed into vectors
-   a vector database performs the search
-   a .NET API orchestrates everything and returns the relevant passages

Why this choice?

👉 **almost zero cost**,\
👉 independence,\
👉 and the ability to iterate quickly.

Eventually, I will probably move to embeddings generated by more recent
AI models (better understanding, better robustness), but for now, I like
this approach: no surprise bills.

Whatever engine I use, the goal stays the same: provide a useful *and
sourced* answer, rather than a convincing hallucination.

## Using the MO5 index directly in your IDE (Copilot, Augment, Claude...)

Thanks to the **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, your AI can plug into my
knowledge base **as if nothing special was happening**... and suddenly
become a **MO5 specialist**.

### 1️⃣ Installing the MCP server

1.  **Clone the repository:**

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/thlg057/mo5-mcp-server.git
cd mo5-mcp-server
```

2.  **Preparation**

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.

On Linux/macOS, make `index.js` executable:

``` bash
chmod +x index.js
```

### 2️⃣ Configuring the MCP client

Add this to your configuration JSON file (Copilot, Augment, Claude
Desktop, etc.):

``` json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mo5-rag": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:\\your\\path\\to\\mo5-mcp-server\\index.js"],
      "env": {
        "RAG_BASE_URL": "https://retrocomputing-ai.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The **retrocomputing-ai.cloud** URL points to my .NET API. It handles
vector search, assembles the response and acts as an interface between
your IDE and the documents.

The MCP server simply acts as the bridge, cleanly, without hacks.

## What's next?

The project evolves more through **experiments** than through big
planned milestones.

I keep improving the documentation as I go, sometimes fixing old
misunderstandings, sometimes adding clearer examples. On the development
side, I feel I now understand the **text** mode pretty well, but the
**graphics** mode is another story: more subtle, more demanding... and I
am still learning how to tame it.

So I will take the time, regularly, to update the documentation.\
All my **Markdown** files are available with the RAG server sources,
nothing is hidden, and everything can be read, improved or extended.

And if you feel like contributing, sharing documents, fixes, or ideas:
**get in touch.** On my own, I won't be able to keep this service alive
forever, and I would really love it to become a useful tool for everyone
who loves retro computing.

Enjoy 😄
